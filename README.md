This project is part of the Odin Project's Foundation Course on CSS. This project has us apply all the knowledge we have learned about Flexbox to create a website design from a provided image. 

UPDATE: Note that I started configuring this while my Google Chrome was zoomed at 80% before realising and so for best intended results it is a good idea to zoom to 80% for this current project. I still have much to learn when it comes to true responsive design. This project focused solely on using Flexbox placement rather than using responsive design elements. 

FINAL UPDATE: This project was a lot of fun for me and the first time I have had general success in using Flexbox to create a webpage. I struggled with the previous Flexbox exercises and so I thought I would also really struggle with this but somehow it seems I have picked up the basic concepts when it comes to placement using Flexbox. 

Understandably I still have a lot to learn when it comes to responsive design when using Flexbox but as stated previously this particular project was about applying Flexbox positioning concepts more than incorperating responsive design which will be coming up later in this curriculum/course.
